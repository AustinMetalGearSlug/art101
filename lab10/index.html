					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
					<p>- The challenge for this lab was to use Jqurey to make a responsive button that responds to the 
						user's input. I deiced to have the user talk to a dinosaur. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p>- I didn't face to many issues as I followed from the examples done during lab and section
						study whiched helped me with making a fun responsive function in JS and shows how helpful testing 
						out JS code in JS bin and also using a console.log to see if their is an error occuring in JS.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
		            <p>- The lab was alot of fun as it helped me with creating a better understanding of JS and using Jqurey but 
						also better format and strucutre with selecting the elements from my documents. I'm still having trouble as when I first 
						ran my code it would either not reply to the user's input or would repeat the user input but after using trial and error 
						I was able to have my code finally working.
