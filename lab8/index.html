					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p>- At first I had issues I had issues having my array results output show on my webpage but after looking
						my code I realized my issue and had to declare my variables and check for spelling errors. But I also 
						looked for the issues in JS that showed my varibales as being undefined. After I went back and edited.

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p>- This lab was both diffcult but helped become better at Javascript and a working flow working between JS and using 
						inspection to test and look for any errors in my code. Also my lab partner Charles was also really helpful in helping me
					 any issues with my code and questions that I have.</p>
