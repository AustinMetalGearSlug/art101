					<h2>Challenge</h2>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p>- I decided to go and redo parts of 
						my lab 7, 10 and 11 as I want to combine getting a user's input and change their output to a Metal Gear Solid codename 
					 and based on the length of the user's name they will be assigned to a special forces group from Metal Gear.</p>
