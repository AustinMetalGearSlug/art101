			<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools and Strategies</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
					<p>- The challenge for this lab was to debug and also refactor a previous lab by utilizing 
						debugging tools and strategies in our webpages and JS scripts. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p>- when I was working on my lab I did encounter some issues. For instance I was having 
						issues connecting my lab14 to lab14, which was the lab I was refactoring. I changed the name of it
						to make it easier to find and better link between my lab14 and to my homepage. I found this issue by inspecting
						the console and following the steps to change it. But I had some issues with my JS mainly being typos and variables 
						but undeclared. I solved by testing different parts and making comment blocks to help my code but overall I wanted to combine
						three of the labs I had most fun with and wanted to combine all of them together and make it better.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p>- I decided to go and redo parts of 
						my lab 7, 10 and 11 as I want to combine getting a user's input and change their output to a Metal Gear Solid codename 
					 and based on the length of the user's name they will be assigned to a special forces group from Metal Gear.</p>
