					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
                    <p> - At first my code wasnt working an didnt display. I had some errors by checking the console
                        and found I missed type "ajaxcomc" instead of "ajaxComic" for the output. But would load but I added comments to 
                        help strucutre my code.
                    </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
			        <p> - Was hard but I was able to find an example on W3S school to follow and also the example done in class for last lecutre and 
                        the one provided on the canvas page helped me gettting started.
