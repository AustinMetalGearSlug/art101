			<h1>Lab 11 -JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
					<p>- The challenge for this lab was to JS and Jqurey and create a button and section for a user 
						to enter and rearrange their name and the output shown in a text box.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p>- At first my code wasnt working as I was able to have the button set and the output but it 
						didn't appear in my output box. I check the console and realized that my issue was that a missspell 
						of one of my lines od code and I also didnt select the proper element and didnt have my code appear 
						under "name-section" and was still under "minor-section".
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p>- As I continue working with JS I find each lab challenging but not too diffuclt. I mainly have an issue declaring my
						functions or organizing my CSS to my JS and how to better track how I am better decalring and selecting elements. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>- Below I have my button working with a user input and a output section to show how the 
						JS function displays the user's output and displays their name as a new dinosaur name.
