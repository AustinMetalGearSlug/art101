					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
					<p>- For this lab our challenge was to create functions that create buttons on our webpage using
						JQurey and libaries to change elements on the webpage.
					</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p>- When I started on my lab I had some issues, I was able to create the interactive buttons
						but weren't working as imputed the function declarions incorrectly or didn't write the code correctly. 
						I reached out to my lab partner, Charles, to help and he was able to explain my declartions and how to properly 
						format my code. I also used the examples and practiced some of the demos show at W3Schools.
					</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<P>- Working on this assignment was challenge but I feel like that I learned alot but also encouraged me to try 
						and spend time more often using W3Schools and also the Xtask assignments as well. I also made sure to start early to
						give me enough time to work and learn while working on the lab.
