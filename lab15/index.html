					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
                    <p> - The challenge for this lab was to find a API and use AJAX to get an API to appear on our webpage </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
                    <p> - The lab wasnt too difficult the example shown in lab and our lecture was really simple to 
                        follow and the main issue I had that my code didn't work but I went back and realized I missed the
                        button for my code but also it was finding a fun API to use but I found an API that generates dinosaur names.
                    </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
			        <p> - The lab wasnt to bad but fun to do and go through different APIs and fun one to use for my lab. But also
                        I hope to find something to use for my group project.
                    </p>
