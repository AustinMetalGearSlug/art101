					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p>- This was one of the more challenging labs done so far as it was alot of trial and error and testing out my 
						code to make sure it functioned correctly. I did learn another way with w3S school to link images though JS instead of using CSS.
